# üì° SDR Analysis and Research

Welcome to the SDR Analysis and Research repository! This project involves hands-on exploration and analysis of signals using Software Defined Radio (SDR). The exercises focus specifically on practical use of SDR# (SDRSharp) for capturing, identifying, and analyzing radio frequency signals.

## üéØ Objectives
- Familiarize with SDR# software and signal exploration techniques.
- Capture and analyze FM radio signals, noting critical attributes like frequency, signal strength, noise floor, and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **SDR# (SDRSharp)**
- **Airspy SDR**

## üìö Project Files
- [`SDR LAB Results.pdf`](https://github.com/DDMetoyer/SDR-Analysis-and-Research/blob/main/SDR%20LAB%20Results%20copy.pdf)
## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### Step 1: Software and Hardware Setup
- Installation of SDR# from [Airspy](https://airspy.com/download).
- Setup and initial configuration to tune into radio signals.

### Step 2: FM Radio Signal Exploration
- Tune SDR# to a known FM frequency (99.9 MHz).
- Capture screenshots of observed signals in SDR#.

### Step 3: Signal Attribute Identification
- **Frequency:** 99.9 MHz
- **Peak Signal Strength:** -28.9 to -36.9 dBFS
- **Noise Floor:** -53.7 to -58.6 dBFS
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** 18.5 to 22.8 dB

## üìä Findings & Analysis
- Confirmed successful identification and clear observation of FM radio signals.
- Analysis of peak strength, noise floor, and SNR demonstrated effective signal capturing and interpretation using SDR#.

## üö© Conclusion
This hands-on SDR exercise successfully introduced fundamental concepts in signal capturing and analysis, effectively demonstrating the capabilities and practical usage of SDR# in cybersecurity and RF research.
